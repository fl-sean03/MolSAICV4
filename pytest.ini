# Pytest configuration for MolSAIC V4 (repo root)
#
# Notes:
# - We intentionally scope test discovery to ./tests so we don't accidentally
#   collect tests from submodules (e.g. src/usm/tests, src/upm/tests) when
#   running `pytest` at the monorepo root.
# - Add ./src to pythonpath so tests can import molsaic/external/pm2mdfcar
#   without requiring an editable install.
